Web app for creating mosaic images based on search results. Early alpha, currently does nothing but allow itself to mingle with Bing's awful APIs.

In order to experience this mingling though, navigate to the project directory and start a python server with

i	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

otherwise you'll get a whole bunch of ugly security errors or some silly shit like that.
